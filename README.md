# About Me
My name is Sebastian Switakowski and I'm learning to become a front-end developer. I'm at the beginning of my journey, currently learning the basics of JavaScript.

## Overview

This challenge was creating an application to generate random passwords based on user criteria. This application runs in a browser. Passwords can include small and big letters, numbers, and special characters.

Firstly I’ve created a function for the password options a user provides. I’ve decided to use “prompt” for password length only and “confirm” for the rest of the options. For “prompt” I’ve used a logical comparison to alert the wrong password length. For “confirm” options I’ve used the same method to alert if no character type is selected. All selections are returned as objects. To get random elements from the array I’ve created a new array and used “Math.random” method. Finally created a pool of characters based on user experience and used concatenation then used a loop to return the password.


## Instructions
